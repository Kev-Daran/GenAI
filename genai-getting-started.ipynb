      "\n",
      "**General Facts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What are they?** Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated terrestrial ecosystems for over 160 million years, from the late Triassic period (about 230 million years ago) until the end of the Cretaceous period (about 66 million years ago).\n",
      "*   **Where did they live?** All over the world! Dinosaur fossils have been found on every continent, even Antarctica.\n",
      "*   **When did they live?** The Mesozoic Era, often called the Age of Reptiles. It's divided into the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods.\n",
      "*   **How did they die out?** Most non-avian dinosaurs went extinct in a mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period, likely caused by a large asteroid impact. This event also wiped out many other forms of life.\n",
      "*   **Are they all extinct?** Not entirely! Birds are now widely accepted by scientists as being direct descendants of small, feathered theropod dinosaurs. So, technically, dinosaurs are still with us!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Types of Dinosaurs (Broad Categories):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Saurischians (Lizard-hipped):**\n",
      "    *   **Theropods:** Bipedal, mostly carnivorous dinosaurs. Includes iconic species like *Tyrannosaurus rex*, *Velociraptor*, and *Spinosaurus*. Birds evolved from small theropods.\n",
      "    *   **Sauropodomorphs:** Long-necked, herbivorous dinosaurs. Includes the giant sauropods like *Brachiosaurus*, *Apatosaurus*, and *Diplodocus*.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ornithischians (Bird-hipped):**\n",
      "    *   A diverse group of herbivorous dinosaurs with a \"bird-like\" hip structure (although birds actually evolved from the lizard-hipped saurischians!). Includes:\n",
      "        *   **Stegosaurs:** Known for their plates and spiked tails. *Stegosaurus* is a famous example.\n",
      "        *   **Ankylosaurs:** Heavily armored dinosaurs with clubbed tails. *Ankylosaurus* is a prime example.\n",
      "        *   **Ornithopods:** A diverse group of herbivores, including *Iguanodon*, *Parasaurolophus*, and hadrosaurs (duck-billed dinosaurs).\n",
      "        *   **Ceratopsians:** Horned dinosaurs like *Triceratops* and *Styracosaurus*.\n",
      "        *   **Pachycephalosaurs:** Dome-headed dinosaurs. *Pachycephalosaurus* is well-known.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fun Facts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   *Argentinosaurus* is one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered, estimated to be over 100 feet long.\n",
      "*   *Microraptor* was a small, feathered dinosaur with four wings, one on each arm and leg.\n",
      "*   Fossil evidence, like dinosaur footprints and bite marks, tells us a lot about how dinosaurs behaved and interacted with each other.\n",
      "*   Paleontologists are still discovering new dinosaur species and learning more about these fascinating creatures all the time.\n",

       "**General Facts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **What are they?** Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated terrestrial ecosystems for over 160 million years, from the late Triassic period (about 230 million years ago) until the end of the Cretaceous period (about 66 million years ago).\n",
       "*   **Where did they live?** All over the world! Dinosaur fossils have been found on every continent, even Antarctica.\n",
       "*   **When did they live?** The Mesozoic Era, often called the Age of Reptiles. It's divided into the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods.\n",
       "*   **How did they die out?** Most non-avian dinosaurs went extinct in a mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period, likely caused by a large asteroid impact. This event also wiped out many other forms of life.\n",
       "*   **Are they all extinct?** Not entirely! Birds are now widely accepted by scientists as being direct descendants of small, feathered theropod dinosaurs. So, technically, dinosaurs are still with us!\n",
       "\n",
       "**Types of Dinosaurs (Broad Categories):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Saurischians (Lizard-hipped):**\n",
       "    *   **Theropods:** Bipedal, mostly carnivorous dinosaurs. Includes iconic species like *Tyrannosaurus rex*, *Velociraptor*, and *Spinosaurus*. Birds evolved from small theropods.\n",
       "    *   **Sauropodomorphs:** Long-necked, herbivorous dinosaurs. Includes the giant sauropods like *Brachiosaurus*, *Apatosaurus*, and *Diplodocus*.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Ornithischians (Bird-hipped):**\n",
       "    *   A diverse group of herbivorous dinosaurs with a \"bird-like\" hip structure (although birds actually evolved from the lizard-hipped saurischians!). Includes:\n",
       "        *   **Stegosaurs:** Known for their plates and spiked tails. *Stegosaurus* is a famous example.\n",
       "        *   **Ankylosaurs:** Heavily armored dinosaurs with clubbed tails. *Ankylosaurus* is a prime example.\n",
       "        *   **Ornithopods:** A diverse group of herbivores, including *Iguanodon*, *Parasaurolophus*, and hadrosaurs (duck-billed dinosaurs).\n",
       "        *   **Ceratopsians:** Horned dinosaurs like *Triceratops* and *Styracosaurus*.\n",
       "        *   **Pachycephalosaurs:** Dome-headed dinosaurs. *Pachycephalosaurus* is well-known.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Fun Facts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   *Argentinosaurus* is one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered, estimated to be over 100 feet long.\n",
       "*   *Microraptor* was a small, feathered dinosaur with four wings, one on each arm and leg.\n",
       "*   Fossil evidence, like dinosaur footprints and bite marks, tells us a lot about how dinosaurs behaved and interacted with each other.\n",
       "*   Paleontologists are still discovering new dinosaur species and learning more about these fascinating creatures all the time.\n",

       "The wind howled a mournful dirge across the ravaged landscape, whipping strands of Anya’s hair across her face. She clung to the rooftop, her Survey Corps cloak flapping like a tattered wing. Paradis Island, her home, was a nightmare painted in shades of grey and crimson. Not just from the recent rumbling, but from years of relentless Titan attacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Anya wasn't Mikasa or Levi, blessed with superhuman strength and grace. She was a tactician, a strategist. Her weapons were not blades and thunder spears, but information and observation. Now, though, her mind felt as shattered as the buildings around her.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Jaegerists had won. Eren, driven by some unfathomable goal, had unleashed the Rumbling, trampling the world beneath the feet of colossal Titans. The Survey Corps, once symbols of hope, were now fractured, some siding with Eren, others clinging to the futile hope of stopping him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Anya, along with a handful of loyalists, was holed up in what remained of Trost District, a ghost town haunted by the screams of the past. Their supplies were dwindling, morale was lower, and every dawn felt like a prelude to their own extinction.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Anything?” Hanji, her voice raspy from smoke and exhaustion, joined Anya on the rooftop. Her single eye, usually bright with scientific curiosity, held a weariness that pierced Anya’s heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "Anya shook her head, her throat too tight to speak. The horizon was a wall of Titans, a monstrous, slow-moving death sentence.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We need a plan, Hanji,” Anya finally managed, her voice barely a whisper. “We can’t just sit here and wait to be crushed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Hanji sighed, running a hand through her greasy hair. “Plan? What plan is there? Eren is unstoppable. He’s… he’s gone.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Anya gripped the edge of the roof, knuckles white. “He’s not gone. There has to be a weakness. There always is.” She thought of Eren, a boy she had trained alongside, a boy driven by righteous fury. Could he truly be so far gone?\n",
       "\n",
       "That night, sleepless, Anya studied the maps spread out on a battered table. She poured over reports of past Titan encounters, searching for patterns, for anything that could give them an edge. She knew the location of the founding Titan was key, and she had a theory.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The spinal fluid,\" she muttered, tracing a finger across a map showing potential paths for the Rumbling. \"The source of the Titan power... it has to be connected to a specific point.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She realised that the Rumbling was slow. If Eren was concentrating on using the founder ability, he was sacrificing coordination. He was a single point of vulnerability in a wall of unstoppable destruction.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next morning, Anya presented her plan to the remaining members of her group. It was reckless, almost suicidal, but it was their only hope. They would use the cover of the Titans to get close to Eren. They would aim for his nape. One well-placed thunder spear, and maybe, just maybe, they could break the Rumbling.\n",
       "\n",
       "The plan was met with skepticism and fear, but Anya’s unwavering conviction, the desperate fire in her eyes, convinced them. They had nothing left to lose.\n",
       "\n",
       "Under the cover of darkness, they launched their attack. Using their 3D maneuver gear, they navigated the treacherous landscape, dodging falling debris and the ever-present threat of the colossal Titans. The heat emanating from the walking giants was suffocating, the ground vibrating with each earth-shattering step.\n",
       "\n",
       "The journey was brutal. Several members of Anya’s group fell, crushed or burned alive. The air was thick with the smell of death and despair. But Anya pressed on, fueled by a desperate hope and a burning determination to save what was left of her world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they reached their target: Eren. He stood within the skeletal form of the Founding Titan, his face obscured by the bone-like armor.\n",
       "\n",
       "Anya took a deep breath, the roar of the Rumbling a deafening cacophony around her. She raised her thunder spear, her hand trembling. This was it. The fate of the world rested on this one shot.\n",
       "\n",
       "Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Mikasa, her eyes filled with tears, her expression a mixture of anguish and resolve.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Anya, don’t!” she cried. “There has to be another way!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Anya hesitated. Mikasa was Eren’s closest friend, his protector. Could she be right? Was there a way to save him, to stop the Rumbling without killing him?\n",
       "\n",
       "But as Anya looked into Mikasa’s eyes, she saw not hope, but despair. Mikasa knew what had to be done. She just couldn’t bring herself to do it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Anya steeled herself. This wasn't about right or wrong. It was about survival. It was about saving the world from annihilation.\n",
       "\n",
       "With a cry of defiance, Anya fired the thunder spear. The weapon soared through the air, striking Eren’s nape with devastating force.\n",
       "\n",
       "The effect was immediate. The Rumbling faltered, the earth shaking less violently. The colossal Titans stumbled, their movements becoming erratic. The power that fueled them, the power that had ravaged the world, was weakening.\n",
       "\n",
       "Eren’s colossal form collapsed to the ground with a deafening crash. The world held its breath.\n",
       "\n",
       "Had it worked? Had they succeeded?\n",
       "\n",
       "As the dust settled, Anya looked at Mikasa. Mikasa's face was covered in tears. She was not happy, but relived. Mikasa knew this was the only way. \n",
       "\n",
       "She nodded at Anya, and Anya finally felt a small sense of hope bloom in her heart. It was over. The Rumbling had stopped. They had saved the world. But at what cost? The scars of the war would forever mark Paradis Island, a reminder of the darkness they had faced and the sacrifices they had made. \n",
       "\n",
       "Anya knew that the future was uncertain, but for the first time in a long time, she felt a flicker of optimism. They had survived. They had a chance to rebuild, to heal, to create a better world. And that, she realized, was worth fighting for. The fight wasn't over, but this was the first step to freedom.\n"
